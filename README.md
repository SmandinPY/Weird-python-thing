# InpyTime
This is a (quite simple) speedrun retiming tool made in Python. It actually goes up to nanoseconds if you'd find that useful.

You can adjust the starting frame by pressing S or clicking on the starting frame textbox. You can also adjust the ending frame by pressing E or clicking on the ending frame textbox.
