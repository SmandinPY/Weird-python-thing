# InpyTime
This is a (quite simple) speedrun retiming tool made in Python.

You can adjust the starting frame to whatever the starting frame is in your speedrun by pressing S. You can also adjust the ending frame by pressing E.
This is a testing build so i'd recommend to just ignore this build and download a newer one. kek
